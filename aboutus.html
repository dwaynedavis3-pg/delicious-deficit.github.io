        <h3>What Is A Deficit?</h3>

        <p class="centered-paragraph">
            Eating at a calorie deficit means consuming fewer calories than your body needs to maintain its current weight, which
            leads to fat loss over time. It's an effective approach for weight management, as it encourages the body to burn stored
            fat for energy. By focusing on nutrient-dense, lower-calorie foods, you can achieve a calorie deficit while still feeling
            satisfied and nourished.
        </p>

        <p class="centered-paragraph">
